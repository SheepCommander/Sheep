1. Do entire bathing routine first, letting skin and hair get as soft as possible
2. Exfoliate (loofah, or acid?)
3. At edge of bath (so not getting wet) apply cream. Apply to one section (left upper) at a time.
4. Shave in short strips, slightly overlapping. Don't go over same spots multiple times.
5. **Pat** dry (do not scrub)
6. Apply aloe to entire lower body (moisturizer might clog?)
	- Also apply again next day maybe
