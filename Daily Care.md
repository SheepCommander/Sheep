- Pull hair apart, and keep hair straight 
- Shampoo 1: Half/half top/back, remainder on palms to sides. Use fingertips. (Don't foam!!)
- Shampoo 2: To get the oil
- Keep hair straight. Gently squeeze water out of hair without scrunching.
- Conditioner: Rub into hands for more even spread. Keep going until slippery feeling everywhere (not the roots).
	- Only do conditioner below the ears
- Clamp up for 2 minutes while finishing other shower stuff. Dry with microfiber cloth, do not rub; press. (I'll just use a hair dryer)

[Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/feminineboys/comments/lfo7ar/my_guide_to_shaving_your_legs_as_a_femboyamab )
1. Do entire bathing routine first, letting skin and hair get as soft as possible
2. Exfoliate (loofah, or acid?)
3. At edge of bath (so not getting wet) apply cream. Apply to one section (left upper) at a time.
4. Shave in short strips, slightly overlapping. Don't go over same spots multiple times.
5. **Pat** dry (do not scrub)
6. Apply aloe to entire lower body (moisturizer might clog?)
	- Also apply again next day maybe
